# Cod3 plugin

## The new free and open source AI-first plugin for JetBrains IDEs

The plugin is currently being under development and I'm daily contributing new features and covering all the base functionality to implement features from the world's leading solutions.

<!-- Plugin description -->
Cod3 brings an AI-native chat experience to JetBrains IDEs. Draft prompts, stream responses, inspect MCP tool calls, and apply changes without leaving the editor. The plugin supports popular LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, local Ollama/LLaMA), inline editing flows, and Agent Client Protocol integrations for external agents and tools.
<!-- Plugin description end -->

## Roadmap
1. Implement the most popular LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, or your custom ones using LLaMA or Ollama)
2. Cursor-like UX flow for inline chat
3. Custom reranker & embedder
4. Multiple useful modes & UI integrations, more customization through actions
5. MCP servers support
